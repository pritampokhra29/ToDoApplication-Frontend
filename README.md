## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.tsx                 # Main application component
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ App.css                 # Enhanced styling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apiService.ts       # Backend API communication
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ validationService.ts # Form validation logic
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### Key Services

#### API Service
- Centralized HTTP client with Axios
- Automatic JWT token handling
- Error handling and retry logic
- Support for all backend endpoints:
  - Authentication (login, logout)
  - Task management (CRUD operations)
  - User management (Admin operations)
  - Dashboard statistics

#### Validation Service
- Real-time form validation
- Comprehensive validation rules:
  - Username: 3-50 characters, alphanumeric + underscore
  - Email: Valid format, max 100 characters
  - Password: 6-100 characters with complexity requirements
  - Task fields: Title, description, dates, etc.

## Backend API Compatibility

This React.js application is fully compatible with the existing backend API:

### Authentication Endpoints

- `POST /auth/register` - User registration (Admin only)

### Task Management Endpoints
- `GET /tasks` - Get all tasks
- `POST /tasks` - Create new task
- `POST /tasks/update` - Update task
- `POST /tasks/delete` - Delete task
- `POST /tasks/get` - Get specific task
- `GET /tasks/categories` - Get task categories

### User Management Endpoints (Admin)
- `GET /auth/admin/users` - Get all users
- `POST /auth/admin/users/{id}` - Update user
- `DELETE /auth/admin/users/{id}` - Delete user
- `GET /auth/users/active` - Get active users

### Dashboard Endpoints
- `GET /dashboard/stats` - Get dashboard statistics
- `GET /dashboard/analytics` - Get analytics data

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Backend server running on `http://localhost:8080`

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd todoapplication-reactjs

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Available Scripts
```bash
npm start          # Runs the app in development mode
npm run build      # Builds the app for production
npm test           # Launches the test runner
npm run eject      # Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation)
```

### Environment Configuration

The application uses different API endpoints for development and production:

#### Environment Files
- `.env.development` - Development environment (localhost backend)
- `.env.production` - Production environment (deployed backend)
- `.env` - Default fallback environment

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Development (.env.development)
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=development

# Production (.env.production)
REACT_APP_API_URL=https://todoapplication-wlvh.onrender.com
REACT_APP_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

#### Usage
- **Development**: `npm start` - Uses `.env.development`
- **Production Build**: `npm run build` - Uses `.env.production`
- **Custom Environment**: Set `NODE_ENV=production npm start` to use production API in development

## Usage

### Default Login Credentials
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
